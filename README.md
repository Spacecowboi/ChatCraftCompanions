### Prisma DB
- every time the Prisma schema is updated (/prisma/schema.prisma), you must run these two commands:
- `npx prisma generate`
- `npx prisma db push`
- this regenerates the schema and then pushes it to PlanetScale
- it's always best to restart the server once this has happened
- to run the prisma viewer: `npx prisma studio`


## Stripe

- when working to test stripe payments, make sure that this is running:
  - `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook`
